# face-emotion-recognition
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing facial emotions from images using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model is trained on a dataset of facial images and can classify emotions into categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.

Features
* Data Augmentation: Implements data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
* CNN Architecture: Utilizes a deep CNN architecture with Batch Normalization and Dropout layers for better performance.
* Callbacks: Includes early stopping and learning rate reduction on plateau to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency.
* Data Visualization: Provides visualizations of training history and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
* OpenCV Integration: Integrates OpenCV for real-time emotion prediction from images.
Installation
1 Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
cd facial-emotion-recognition
2 Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the paths to your training and test datasets in the script.
Usage
3 Train the Model:
Copy code
python train_model.py
4 Evaluate the Model:
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
5 Predict Emotions in New Images:
Copy code
python predict_emotion.py --image_path path_to_new_image.jpg

Example
 python
Copy code
import cv2
from model import predict_emotion_opencv

image_path = 'path_to_new_image.jpg'
predict_emotion_opencv(image_path)

Results
* Training History: Visualizes accuracy and loss curves over epochs.
* Confusion Matrix: Displays the confusion matrix for the test dataset.
